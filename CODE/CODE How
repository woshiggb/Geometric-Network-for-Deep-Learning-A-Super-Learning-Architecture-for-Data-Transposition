The artificial intelligence model studied in this paper, based on composite learning - advanced neuron learning in ecosystems, demonstrates unique advantages in dataset learning and model performance. 
It exhibits relatively good fitting effects, particularly evident in dataset learning (other aspects are also good). Testing method: Download the zip program, unzip it, and use coders2 or others.
The following libraries are needed for testing: numpy, matplotlib, sympy.
